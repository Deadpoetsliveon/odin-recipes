        <h1> Everything including the kitchen Sink (pasta)</h1>
        <p> For the unsanitary pasta lovers, who wish to add a little "je ne sais quoi" to their dish. The flavour profile will change dramatically based on cleanliness. For a more pronounced taste, try a dirtier sink. </p>
        <h2> In-greedy-ents:</h2>
        <p> Get creative, get greedy. Use whatever you got.This is a kitchen sink pasta. Usually it means everything but the kitchen sink. But for the added "Umph" I (<em>a human</em>) recommend using the kitchen sink too. </p>
        <p> Here's what I'd use, if I had a sink</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>A sink. Preferably unclean for more flavour.</li>
            <li> Tomato sauce. Ketchup could be a good alternative <sup><small>1</small></sup></up></li>
            <li> Pasta of choice. If pasta is unavailable, try cutting old sliced bread into strips and baking at a 300<sup><small>o</small></sup> until hardened.</li>
            <li> Onions or onion like items.</li>
            <li> Peppers</li>
            <li> Cheese. Don't worry if it's a bit moldy. Remember: "All cheese is mold, but not all mold is cheese"</li>
            <li> Whatever else is available</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Now let's get cooking!</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2> In-struck-shuns</h2>
        <p> I'm trying to be witty here. Humour me and don't try this at home.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><sup><small>1</small></sup>: Ketchup can be made "saucier" by adding equal parts water. </p>
