    <h2> Game start:</h2>
    <h3> What you'll need</h3>
    <ul>

        <li> Mountain Dew (pick the <ins>greenest</ins> one you can find)</li>
        <li> A bowl (preferably unwashed for added flavor)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol> 
        <li> Finish your game or reach the next checkpoint. A real gamer's game knows no pause.</li>
        <li> Stand up. This may be difficult. Your legs might be sore after such an intense sitting session</li>
        <li> Go to the kitchen. A pit stop to the washroom is acceptable.</li>
        <li> Get your bowl out of the gutter of unwashed dishes</li>
        <li> Open the pantry and take out the Doritos. A true gamer should have <strong> enough supplies to last a Zombie Apocalypse. </strong>  </li>
        <li> Open the fridge and grab some Dew.</li>
        <li> Dump some chips in the bowl</li>
        <li> Pour some Dew to make a stew</li>
        <li> Enjoy with a spoon or <strong>if you are unstoppable </strong>, enjoy with your soon to be finger licked fingers</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Your results may vary, but here's an example of <b>spicy dewy deliciousness</b> <sup> <small>TM</small></sup></p>
